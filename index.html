        <h6>Brief biographical sketch:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">September 10, 1908:</span> Harry Warnow is born in Brooklyn, NY.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1931: </span>Warnow graduates from the Institute of Musical Art (later known as the Julliard
            School). </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1934: </span>Warnow joins the CBS Radio Orchestra as a pianist, which was conducted by his brother
            Mark. To avoid accusations of favoritism in hiring, Harry Warnow adopted the name Raymond Scott, which he selected
            at random from the Manhattan phone book. He composes his first hit record for the orchestra, <span class="italic">Christmas Night in Harlem</span>.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1936: </span>The Raymond Scott Quintette is formed with Lou Shoobe on bass, Dave Harris on tenor
            saxophone, Pete Pumiglio on clarinet, Johnny Williams on drums, and Bunny Berigan on trumpet. The Quintette performs
            on the <span class="italic">Saturday Night Swing Club</span> program on CBS.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1937: </span>The Raymond Scott Quintette signs with Master Records, the record label run by
            Duke Ellington's manager, Irving Mills, and records many of Scott's well known early compositions such as "Twilight
            in Turkey", "Powerhouse", and "The Toy Trumpet".</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1939: </span>The original Raymond Scott Quintette is disbanded in the summer after recording
            releases for Columbia Records, and the full-sized Raymond Scott Orchestra is formed, signing to Columbia in November.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1942: </span>Scott forms the first racially integrated orchestra for network radio. He also
            meets his future wife, Dorothy Collins.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1943: </span>Carl Stalling, music director for the Warner Bros. animation department, makes
            his first quotations of Raymond Scott compositions after Scott sold the publishing rights to Warners. Thus began
            Raymond Scott's reputation as a "cartoon composer".</span>
          </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1946: </span>Scott establishes his electronic music production company, Manhattan Research,
            Inc., which files its first patent disclosures that year.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1949: </span>Mark Warnow dies of heart failure; Raymond Scott takes over as director of the
            Lucky Strike Hit Parade Orchestra.</span>
          </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1950: </span><span class="italic">Your Hit Parade</span> moves from CBS Radio to NBC Television.

          <li><span class="bold">1951: </span>The Jingle Workshop, Scott's music company for commercials, is established.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1952: </span>Scott marries Dorothy Collins, and creates the Clavivox keyboard as a keyed adaptation
            of a theremin for their daughter Carolyn. Scott also built two early incarnations of multitrack audio recorders
            that year.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1955: </span>Scott meets a young Bob Moog for the first time, who he contracted with to build
            theremin-based tone generation components for the Clavivox.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1956: </span>A patent is granted for the Clavivox.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1957: </span><span class="italic">Your Hit Parade</span> is cancelled.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1959: </span>Scott develops the first version of his combined synthesis and automated music
            composition device, the Electronium.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1960: </span>Scott invents two more electronic music devices, the rhythm synthesizer and the
            pitch sequencer.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1963: </span><span class="italic">Soothing Sounds for Baby</span>, Scott's three LP series intended
            for infants but later cited as a precursor to what would become ambient music, is released on Epic Records. Scott
            also develops a drum machine that he calls "Bandito the Bongo Artist".</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1970: </span>Scott meets Berry Gordy of Motown Records, who orders an Electronium.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1987: </span>Scott suffers a stroke that leaves him unable to work or speak.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">February 8, 1994: </span>Raymond Scott dies at the age of 85.</li>
        </ul>
        <quote><span class="italic">"Being introduced to the music of Raymond Scott was like being given the name of a composer I feel I have heard my whole life, who until now was nameless. Clearly he is a major American composer."</span>â€”David
          Harrington, Kronos Quartet</quote>
